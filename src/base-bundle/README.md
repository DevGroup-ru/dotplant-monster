## Grid system

Grid system is port of reflex grid system.

Bootstrap folder contains 2 files: `grid-5.css` and `grid-12.css` for 5 and 12-column based grids.
This files are automatically generated by gulp from "reflex" folders(postcss generates ready-to-use postcss mixins).


## Core bundles

`bootstrap` bundle MUST NOT add any CSS to the result. It is used by another bundles and provides mixins for them.
`core` bundle includes resets and standard monster styles. This bundle is included in every browsers request.
`visual-builder` is for visual builder interface only.

### How to develop new bundle

1. ...
2. Copy `bootstrap` bundle and import it
3. ...
4. PROFIT!
